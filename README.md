# assignment_2_Mockup-
This is a function mockup for Newbie's Coffee. A few changes have been implemented for the functional mockup.


-Using grids to make the cards due to a filtering issue utilizing materialize formatting.

-Coffee.jpg is outside the files with index.html because it is a placeholder image. When more images are added for the final then an image folder will be made.

-ALL Placeholder text for the cards use "Lorem ipsum...." text. 

-The Ingredients button links each recipe card to it's own page which displays the recipe in more detail. 

New Implementation:

+Instead of adding a search feature for the "HOME" page...I implemented a feature by category option to allow new users to scroll through different categories and discover different recipes.
